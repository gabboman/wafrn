    <li>By default, <b>all bluesky posts are public</b> wich means there is no unlisted post</li>

      Its owned by a corporation and they may not be your jam. We will do the best to protect you from possible stupid
      things they might do in the future
    </li>
    <li>
      Bluesky blocks are public by default. We are still not federating them, but we will add the option to make your
      blocks on bluesky public in the future
    </li>
    <li>
      Some posts may be marked as "only people i follow can reply" and stuff like that. We are still working on this
    </li>
    <li>Like on fedi, not every post of every account gets saved in wafrn. We only save as much as we need</li>
