      Notifications on bluesky SOMETIMES can be janky. Not seeing a follower on wafrn doesnt mean the follower does not
      exist.

    <li>By default, <b>all bluesky posts are public</b> wich means there is no unlisted post</li>
    <li><b>Bluesky automaticaly accepts all follows by default</b>. Its different from fedi</li>
    <li>Its owned by a corporation and they may not be your jam. We do the best to protect your</li>

      Bluesky blocks are public by default. We are still not federating them, but we will add the option to make your
      blocks on bluesky public in the future

      Some posts may be marked as "only people i follow can reply" and stuff like that. Some jank we havent finished
    </li>
    <li>Like on fedi, not every post of every account gets saved in wafrn. We only save as much as we need</li>
    <li>There is jank</li>
    <li>There is jank and we are on it</li>
    <li>There is A LOT OF JANK and we are on it</li>
