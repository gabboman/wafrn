# AI Contributions Policy

We do not accept contributions that had Artificial Intelligence, specifically Large Language Models or Image Diffusion Models involved in any step. We ask contributors to refrain from contributing code made with such tools. 

This includes, but isn't limited to GitHub Copilot, Zed AI, Cursor.dev's AI features and other "Coding Assistants", as well as full-on code generation through the likes of GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT and others.

This system works based on trust. We trust that you do not lie to us about your usage. We will ask about the usage of AI tools if we see the need, and we will deny pull requests that have Generative AI use in them.
