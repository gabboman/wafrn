# Changelog

##Â 2025-06-19

Update your docker compose file
https://github.com/gabboman/wafrn/releases/tag/2025.07.1

## 2025-05-19

Support has been added to turn on metrics / monitoring using Prometheus, pgwatch and Grafana

To turn it on, replace your `docker-compose.yml` file with one of the others supporting `metrics`, like `docker-compose.simple.metrics.yml`.

You also need to set a few new environment variables, add the following to your `.env` files:

```sh
POSTGRES_METRICS_USER=pgwatch
POSTGRES_METRICS_PASSWORD=<some_random_password>
POSTGRES_METRICS_DBNAME=pgwatch_metrics
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<some_other_random_password>
```

Once you run `docker compose up --build -d` you should be able to check your metrics at `https://monitoring.<your_wafrn_domain>`
